- Wholesale electricity, gas prices drop, but retail bills remain high — EU Commission/ACER — 2025-11-06  
  URL: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/docs_autres_institutions/commission_europeenne/com/2025/0072/COM_COM(2025)0072_EN.pdf  
  Region: EU  
  Summary: EU wholesale power and gas prices have dropped to €82/MWh (electricity) and about €32/MWh (gas), but consumer bills remain elevated due to taxes and grid charges. Fossil fuel imports still exert pressure on overall costs.  
  Key Numbers: Power €82/MWh, gas €32/MWh.  
  Relevance: Shows disconnect between market prices and household cost relief, raising concern over competitiveness.

=== NEWS: EUROPEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGY ===  
- EU selects 8 hydrogen projects for €2.9bn funding — pv magazine — 2025-11-07

  Relevance: Demonstrates major infrastructure commitments to grid modernization in Germany.

- Supercharging the transition with energy storage solutions — Directorate-General for Energy, EU Commission — 2025-09-16  
  URL: https://energy.ec.europa.eu/news/focus-supercharging-transition-energy-storage-solutions-2025-09-16_en  
  Region: EU  
  Summary: Battery costs have declined 93% since 2010; hydropower pumped storage at 46GW capacity provides a quarter of global stored energy. EU expects storage demand to accelerate, especially for mobility and grid-scale solutions.  
  Technical/Risk Notes: Storage technology vital for matching renewables variability and EU supply targets.  
  Relevance: Underlines critical role that energy storage tech is expected to play in meeting EU renewables goals.

=== NEWS: EUROPEAN ENERGY POLITICS & POLICY ===  
- Energy Union Task Force examines measures to bring down prices — EU Commission — 2025-11-04
